My Awesome To-Do List App! ✨

Hello there, fellow web developer! 👋 This is a super simple and neat To-Do List app. It's built using the basic building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This app is designed to help you keep track of your tasks, whether it's for work, study, or just daily chores. Let's get organized! 🚀

What Can This App Do? (Features) 🤩

Add Tasks: Got something to do? Just type it in the box and hit "Add Task" (or press Enter!). It's that easy! ➕

Delete Tasks: Finished a task, or changed your mind? No problem! Click the "Delete" button next to any task to remove it. Bye-bye, task! 👋🗑️

Mark as Done/Undone: To mark a task as complete, simply click on its text. It will get a cool strikethrough! Click again to unmark it. ✅🔄

Looks Good Everywhere: This app is "responsive," meaning it looks great on your phone, tablet, or computer screen. 📱💻

What Web Tools Did I Use? (Technologies) 🛠️

This app uses the essential trio of front-end web development:

HTML5: The skeleton of our app. It defines the content and structure, like the input field, buttons, and where the tasks appear. 🦴

CSS3: The style guru! It makes our app look pretty. CSS handles colors, fonts, spacing, and ensures everything is neatly arranged. Think of it as the app's fashion designer! 🎨👕

JavaScript: The brain of the operation! It makes the app interactive. JavaScript handles adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. It brings the app to life! 🧠✨

How to Get This App Running (Getting Started) 🚀
It's super simple to get this app working on your own computer! You don't need any special software other than a web browser.

What You Need (Prerequisites) 💡
Just your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)! That's it!
